Execute Terraform scripts
In the folder, where our terraform code is located, we run following command:
```
terraform init
``` 
this command downloads and initializes provider plugins and other local settings which will be used in subsequent commands.
```
terraform validate 
```
This command shows us if there are some errors in the terraform code.
```
terraform plan -out create_vms.plan
```
Terraform plan shows what changes in the configuration will be applied to the infrastructure and which resources will be added.
Finally,

```
terraform apply
```
